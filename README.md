Encryption Software written in Python

This encryptor is suppose to be very easy to use and remain relatively secure. AES-256-CTR is the cipher that is used to encrypt the files. The encryption keys are encrypted with AES-256-CTR again but this time with a key derived from the user generated password. This is a project for the Congressional App Challenge, whilst I began over the summer, I've reset it multiple times because it was bloated and did not have the required protection that I wanted. But now I have the feature set all nailed down.
