# encryption_software
Encryption Software written in Python

This encryptor is suppose to be very easy to use and remain relatively secure. So there will only
be 1 cipher suit that being AES-256-CTR with authentication handled with a signed SHA3-512 Hash 
that gets stored with the encryption keys in a .decr file and the encrypted cipher text gets
stored in a .encr file.
