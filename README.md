Encryption Software written in Python

This encryptor is suppose to be very easy to use
and remain relatively secure. So there will only
be 2 cipher suits that being AES-256-CTR and CHA
CHA20 with authentication handled with a signed 
SHA3-512 Hash that gets encrypted with a RSA key
of 3072-bits or more.
